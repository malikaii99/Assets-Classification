# Assets-Classification
<h1>Description</h1>
My task was to categorize the assets within a home office network using my knowledge of asset management, which is a vital aspect of security planning for any organization. It involves monitoring assets and assessing associated risks. The process begins by compiling an inventory or list of assets that require protection. Subsequently, assets are categorized based on their importance and vulnerability to potential risks.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Review the scenario below.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network, and each is a potential entry point to other assets.An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.You’re operating a small business from home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that requires extra protection.
- <a>To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as: </a>
  - Desktop or laptop computers
  - Smartphones
  - Smart home devices
  - Game consoles
  - Storage devices or servers
  - Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device, such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

<h3>Home Asset Inventory</h3>
	<h4>Asset------->Network access------->Owner------->Location------->Notes------->Sensitivity</h4>
 
 - 	Network router------->Continuous------->Internet service provider (ISP)------->On-premises------->Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices on the home network connect to the 5 GHz frequency.------->Confidential
  - Desktop------->Occasional------->Homeowner------->On-premises------->Contains private information, like photos.------->Restricted
  - Guest smartphone------->Occasional------->Friend------->On and Off-premises------->Connects to my home network.------->Internal-only
  - Printer------->Occasional------->Homeowner------->On-premises------->Prints out documents that's used for a variety of purposes------->Internal-only
  - Storage devices or servers------->Continuous------->Homeowner------->On-premises------->Used to store data to access when needed------->Confidential
  - Smart home devices------->Continuous------->Homeowner------->On-premises------->Connects to my home network.------->Internal-only
